# Inventory Management Dashboard Requirements

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Dashboard for managing inventory items. The system aims to provide a user-friendly web interface where users can track, update, and manage stock items, view inventory levels, and ensure operational efficiency.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Overview
- **1.1** Summary statistics showing total items, low stock items, out-of-stock items
- **1.2** Visual representation of inventory levels (charts/graphs)
- **1.3** Recent activity log
- **1.4** Quick action buttons for common tasks

### 2. Inventory Management (CRUD Operations)
- **2.1 Create**
  - Add new inventory items with details like name, description, category, SKU, price, quantity, supplier
  - Upload product images
  - Set minimum stock threshold for low stock alerts
  
- **2.2 Read**
  - View comprehensive list of all inventory items
  - Search functionality with filters (by name, category, SKU, price range)
  - Sorting options for all columns
  - Pagination for large datasets
  - Detailed view for individual items
  
- **2.3 Update**
  - Edit existing inventory details
  - Bulk update functionality for multiple items
  - Stock adjustment with reason logging
  
- **2.4 Delete**
  - Remove items from inventory
  - Archive items instead of permanent deletion
  - Batch delete functionality

### 3. Integration Capabilities
- **3.1** Import/export functionality for bulk data operations
- **3.2** Barcode/QR code scanning support

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Front-end
- Modern JavaScript framework (React, Angular, or Vue.js)
- Responsive CSS framework
- Data visualization libraries for charts and graphs

### 2. Back-end
- RESTful API design
- Database with appropriate indexing for performance

### 3. Database
- Structured schema for inventory items
- Relationships for categories, suppliers, and users
- Efficient query optimization

## Future Enhancements (Version 2.0)
- Mobile application for inventory management on the go
- Multi-location inventory tracking
- Supplier management system
- Integration with accounting software

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Design)**: UI/UX design, database schema design
- **Phase 2 (Core Development)**: Backend API development, frontend CRUD operations
- **Phase 3 (Testing & Deployment)**: User testing, bug fixes, deployment

## Success Criteria
- Fully functional CRUD operations for inventory management
- Intuitive user interface with minimal learning curve
- Reliable system operation
